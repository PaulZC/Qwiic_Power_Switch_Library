# SparkFun Qwiic Power Switch Arduino Library

The Qwiic Power Switch is a simple little board which can be used to switch the power to your Qwiic
system. Many Qwiic boards draw very little current when not being used, but there are some that draw
significantly more. The power switch allows you to switch the power to those boards, so you can minimize the
current draw and extend your battery life when you need to.

This is a library for the PCA9536 4-bit I/O digital expander which lets you control and monitor the Qwiic Power Switch.
